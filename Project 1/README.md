# Project 1

### Goal
Calculating the energy production per unit time per unity mass in the solar core. This is done by first finding the energy produced by known fusion processes in the solar core (individual reactions in the proton-proton chain, and the CNO cycle), then coupling the results with known reaction rates between elements, as a function of temperature.
