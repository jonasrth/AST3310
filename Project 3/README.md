# Project 3

### Goal
Modelling convection in a star by writing a 2D hydrodynamics code. Involves solving the Navier-Stokes equations for an ideal gas.

**Contents:**
- **Images** : Images for the written report
- **Videos** : Videos of the atmosphere simulations
- **AST3310___Project_3.pdf** : Written report on the solution of the project.
- **Project3.py** : Python script for solving the project. Includes class *_2Dconvection* which adds a perturbation to a hydrostatic atmosphere and solves the evolution of the atmosphere over time.
- **FVis3.py** : [FVis](https://github.com/lars-frogner/FVis) is provided by Lars Frogner for the AST3310 course.
